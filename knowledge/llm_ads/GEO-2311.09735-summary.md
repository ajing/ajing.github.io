## TL;DR

First academic paper to formally define **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** - the practice of optimizing web content to be retrieved and cited by AI-powered search engines (like Perplexity, ChatGPT with browsing, etc.).

---

## Key Concept

Traditional SEO optimizes for ranking in a list of links.  
GEO optimizes for **being cited in synthesized AI responses**.

```
SEO:   User → Google → Click on link → Visit site
GEO:   User → AI → Gets answer with sources → May or may not visit site
```

## Research Findings

### 9 Optimization Methods Tested

The paper evaluates multiple GEO optimization strategies:

| Method | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Cite Sources** | Add citations to authoritative sources | ↑ Visibility |
| **Quotation Addition** | Include relevant quotes from experts | ↑ Visibility |
| **Statistics Addition** | Add concrete numbers and data | ↑ Visibility |
| **Fluency Optimization** | Improve readability and flow | ↑ Visibility |
| **Unique Words** | Use distinctive vocabulary | Mixed |
| **Technical Terms** | Include domain-specific language | Domain-dependent |
| **Authoritative Tone** | Write with expertise | ↑ Visibility |
| **Easy-to-Understand** | Simplify complex concepts | ↑ Visibility |
| **Keyword Stuffing** | Traditional SEO technique | ❌ Harmful |

### Key Finding

> **Keyword stuffing (traditional SEO) actually *hurts* GEO visibility**

What works for Google doesn't work for AI engines. Semantic richness beats keyword density.

---

## Visibility Metric

The paper introduces **"Impression"** - how prominently a source appears in AI-generated responses:

- Position in response
- Length of content attributed
- Whether directly quoted vs. paraphrased

---

## Implications for Brands

1. **Traditional SEO isn't enough** - Need dedicated GEO strategy
2. **Content quality matters more** - AI evaluates semantic value, not just keywords
3. **Authority signals transfer** - Citations, quotes, and statistics boost visibility
4. **The game has changed** - Zero-click is now zero-visit if you're not cited

## Connection to GEM (Generative Engine Marketing)

GEO is the **supply side** of the Generative Engine Marketing ecosystem:

```
GEO (Supply)                    GEM (Demand)
────────────                    ────────────
Brands optimize content         Platforms inject ads
to be cited by AI               into AI responses

      Both compete for visibility
       in AI-generated responses
```

---

## Practical Takeaways

### Do More
- Add statistics and data points
- Include citations to authoritative sources
- Write in clear, conversational language
- Answer implicit questions directly

### Do Less
- Keyword stuffing
- Marketing jargon
- Vague claims without evidence
- Dense, hard-to-parse text
